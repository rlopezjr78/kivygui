Senior Experience Project for CS4360

It is often the case that software developers, business owners, market analysts, etc., etc. require certain insights or the ability to gather statistics from the data sets they are working with but lack the ability to reliably do so. After all, you canâ€™t expect everyone to have a strong background in data science and engineering.

Here is where project Quick Stat comes in. Imagine a simple and easy to navigate app that allows a user to retrieve a desired statistic or insight from a particular data set at the press of a button. No previous knowledge of confusing data processing software packages required!

The main problem we wish to address is the lack of data science skills commonly found in many software development teams. Although we recognize that many non-software developers can also benefit from this app.

Specifically, it is often required for software developers to find certain statistics or other relevant insights from the data sets they are working with and usually they will hastily code a possibly flawed solution or spend valuable time researching how to use a particular data science package to find the answers they are seeking.

Both approaches waste time, money, and can negatively affect productivity.

The purpose of this project is to eliminate the need for software designers (and anyone else) to have an extensive knowledge of data science when working on projects with large sets of data.

Our goal is to help save time and money by providing a free and easy tool built with industry leading and tested python data science packages that anyone and everyone can pick up and begin using right away!
